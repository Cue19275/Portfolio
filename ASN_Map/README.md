# ASN Map Interface
This projects consists of an app, that creates a graph of the ASN's that the input ASN has had a relation to in a recent timeframe. This helps us to understand how the wide BGP connections from different internet providers are made from around the world. The code works by using the RIPE API, this gives us access to global ASN interconnection data.
