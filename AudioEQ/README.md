# Two channel and 7 band audio equalizer
 This app consists of an audio equalizer based on python and using LTSpice. A circuit was designed to model the range of gain and attenuation each band could get. The circuit was calculated using ideal OpAmps. Once the circuit schematic and simulation was tested, a python script that automated the parameters of each band according to the desired gain was developed. Finally everything was put together in a GUI using pyQT.
